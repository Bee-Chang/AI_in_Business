# AI_in_Business
This repository is a collection of projects and other works revolving around AI intergration in business.

Business leverage every tool at their disposal to gain an advantage in the competitive market. One such tool is the emerging advancement of generative AI. With generative AI a
business can make faster and more accurate decisions based upon previously acquired data.

As you read throughout this repository you will find my growing understanding of neural networks and how to apply that in developing a machine that can generate an output after 
being trained. Going from understanding CNN to messing around with other generative models to attemping to build my own.
